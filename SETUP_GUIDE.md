# 🚀 Setup Guide - Updated Lost & Found System

## What Was Improved

Your Lost & Found System has been **significantly enhanced** with production-ready features. See `IMPROVEMENTS.md` for a detailed breakdown of all changes.

---

## 🔧 Quick Start

### 1. **Install Dependencies** (if not already done)
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. **Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/lostfound?schema=public"

# NextAuth - MUST be at least 32 characters
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key-here-min-32-characters-long-change-in-production"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Node Environment
NODE_ENV="development"
```

**Important**: Generate a secure `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### 3. **Run Database Migrations**

Apply the new indexes for better performance:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_performance_indexes
```

Or if in production:
```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### 4. **Create an Admin User** (Optional)

```bash
npm run create-admin your-email@example.com your-secure-password
```

Or interactively:
```bash
npm run create-admin
```

### 5. **Start the Development Server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000`

## 🧪 Testing the Improvements

### 1. **Test User Registration**
- Go to `/register`
- Try registering with weak password - should see validation errors
- Try registering with strong password - should succeed

### 2. **Test Item Reporting**
- Go to `/lost` or `/found`
- Try submitting without filling required fields - see validation
- Try uploading large image (>3MB) - should see error
- Submit valid form - should see success

### 3. **Test User Dashboard**
- Sign in
- Go to `/dashboard`
- View your reported items
- Toggle between Lost and Found tabs

### 4. **Test Admin Features**
- Sign in as admin
- Go to `/admin/items`
- Test search functionality
- Test status and category filters
- Click "Find Matches" on an item
- View match scores and breakdowns

### 5. **Test Matching Algorithm**
- Create a lost item: "Blue Nike Backpack" in Electronics
- Create a found item: "Blue Nike Bag" in Electronics  
- Go to admin → Find matches
- Should see high match score with detailed breakdown

## 🐛 Common Issues

### Issue: "DATABASE_URL is required"
**Solution**: Make sure `.env` file exists with correct `DATABASE_URL`

### Issue: "NEXTAUTH_SECRET must be at least 32 characters"
**Solution**: Generate a longer secret using `openssl rand -base64 32`

### Issue: Prisma errors after update
**Solution**: Run `npx prisma generate` and `npx prisma migrate deploy`

### Issue: TypeScript errors
**Solution**: Restart your IDE/TypeScript server. In VS Code: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Restart TS Server"

### Issue: Images not uploading
**Solution**: Ensure `public/uploads/` directory exists and is writable
