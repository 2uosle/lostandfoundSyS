# User Privacy Fix - Personal Dashboard

## Problem

The "My Items" dashboard was showing ALL items from ALL users, which is a serious privacy issue. Users could see items reported by other users.

## Root Cause

The GET endpoints in `/api/items/lost` and `/api/items/found` were fetching all items from the database without filtering by user ID:

```typescript
// BEFORE (WRONG - Shows everyone's items)
prisma.lostItem.findMany({
  orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' },
  skip,
  take: limit,
  // No where clause = returns ALL items
})
```

## Solution

Added `where` clause to filter by the logged-in user's ID:

```typescript
// AFTER (CORRECT - Shows only user's items)
prisma.lostItem.findMany({
  where: {
    userId: session.user.id, // Only this user's items
  },
  orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' },
  skip,
  take: limit,
})
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Lost Items API (`src/app/api/items/lost/route.ts`)
```typescript
const [items, total] = await Promise.all([
  prisma.lostItem.findMany({
    where: {
      userId: session.user.id, // ✅ Filter by user
    },
    // ... rest of query
  }),
  prisma.lostItem.count({
    where: {
      userId: session.user.id, // ✅ Count only user's items
    },
  }),
]);
```

### 2. Found Items API (`src/app/api/items/found/route.ts`)
```typescript
const [items, total] = await Promise.all([
  prisma.foundItem.findMany({
    where: {
      userId: session.user.id, // ✅ Filter by user
    },
    // ... rest of query
  }),
  prisma.foundItem.count({
    where: {
      userId: session.user.id, // ✅ Count only user's items
    },
  }),
]);
```

## Security Improvements

### Before (Vulnerable):
- ❌ Any logged-in user could see ALL items
- ❌ Privacy violation
- ❌ Users could see other people's contact info
- ❌ No data isolation

### After (Secure):
- ✅ Users only see their OWN reported items
- ✅ Privacy protected
- ✅ Contact info is private to the user who reported it
- ✅ Proper data isolation per user

## What Users See Now

### User A (logged in as user123):
```
My Dashboard
├─ Lost Items (2)
│  ├─ Nike Backpack (reported by me)
│  └─ iPhone 13 (reported by me)
└─ Found Items (1)
   └─ Blue Wallet (reported by me)
```

### User B (logged in as user456):
```
My Dashboard
├─ Lost Items (1)
│  └─ Car Keys (reported by me)
└─ Found Items (0)
   └─ (empty - no items found)
```

**User A cannot see User B's items and vice versa!**

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Anonymous Reports (No User ID)
Items with `userId: null` won't show in anyone's dashboard:
```typescript
where: {
  userId: session.user.id // null != session.user.id
}
```

### 2. Admin Access
Admins should still see ALL items. This is handled differently:
- Regular users: `/api/items/lost` → filtered by userId
- Admins: Use admin-specific endpoints that bypass user filtering

### 3. Session Validation
The endpoint already checks for authentication:
```typescript
if (!session?.user) {
  return errorResponse('Unauthorized', 401);
}
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] User can only see their own lost items
- [x] User can only see their own found items
- [x] Other users' items are hidden
- [x] Item counts are accurate per user
- [x] Authentication is required
- [x] No linter errors

## Files Modified

1. `src/app/api/items/lost/route.ts` - Added user filtering
2. `src/app/api/items/found/route.ts` - Added user filtering

## Impact

**Before:** Major privacy vulnerability  
**After:** Proper user data isolation

Each user now has a truly personal dashboard showing only items they reported!
