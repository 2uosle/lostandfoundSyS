# Found Items Update - Photo Required & Date Display

## Changes Made

### 1. Photo Now Required for Found Items

**Frontend Validation (`src/components/ItemReportForm.tsx`):**
- Added client-side validation to require photo upload for found items
- Updated label to show "(required)" for found items vs "(optional)" for lost items
- Added red asterisk (*) to indicate required field
- Added helpful text: "A clear photo helps verify the item and return it to the rightful owner"
- Set HTML5 `required` attribute on file input for found items

**Backend Validation (`src/app/api/items/found/route.ts`):**
- Added server-side check to reject requests without photos
- Returns error: "Photo is required for found items" if no image provided
- Validates image format and size (JPG/PNG, max 3MB)

### 2. Date Field Added to Comparison View

**Type Updates (`src/app/admin/items/page.tsx`):**
- Added `foundDate: Date` to `MatchCandidate` type
- Ensures type safety when displaying found item dates

**UI Updates:**
- Added "Date Found" field in the side-by-side comparison modal
- Displays formatted date using `date-fns` format: "MMM dd, yyyy"
- Positioned between "Location" and "Contact" fields for consistency

## User Experience Improvements

### For Found Item Reports:
1. **Clear Requirements**: Users immediately see that a photo is required
2. **Helpful Context**: Explanation text tells them why the photo is needed
3. **Better Validation**: Both client and server validate the photo requirement
4. **Error Feedback**: Clear error message if they try to submit without a photo

### For Admin Comparison:
1. **Complete Information**: Admins can now see when the item was found
2. **Better Matching**: Date information helps verify if items match based on timeline
3. **Consistent Display**: Both lost and found items now show all relevant date information

## Technical Details

### Validation Flow:
1. **Client-Side**: HTML5 `required` attribute + custom validation before API call
2. **Server-Side**: Explicit check for image presence before processing
3. **Error Handling**: Clear, user-friendly error messages at each step

### Data Structure:
```typescript
type MatchCandidate = {
  item: {
    id: string;
    title: string;
    description: string;
    category: string;
    location: string;
    foundDate: Date;  // ‚Üê Added
    imageUrl: string | null;
    contactInfo: string;
  };
  // ...
};
```
