# Quick Start: Activity Logging System

## What Was Built

A complete **activity tracking and history system** for the Lost & Found admin panel.

## The Problem (Before)

- ❌ Items stayed in the dashboard even after being claimed/archived/deleted
- ❌ No record of what actions admins took
- ❌ Couldn't track who did what
- ❌ Deleted items lost forever

## The Solution (After)

- ✅ All admin actions automatically logged
- ✅ Separate "Activity History" page to view all actions
- ✅ Items removed from main dashboard when archived/claimed/deleted
- ✅ Complete audit trail with admin names and timestamps
- ✅ Deleted items preserved in logs

## How It Works

### 1. **Admin Takes Action**
```
Admin clicks: Archive | Claim | Match | Delete
         ↓
  Action performed
         ↓
  ✓ Item status updated
  ✓ Activity logged in database
  ✓ Item removed from pending list (if needed)
```

### 2. **View History**
```
Go to: Admin Dashboard → Activity History
         ↓
  See table of all actions with:
  - Date & time
  - Action type (with colored badges)
  - Item name
  - Admin who did it
  - Details
```

## What Gets Logged

| Action | What's Saved |
|--------|-------------|
| **MATCH** | Both items, their IDs and titles |
| **CLAIM** | Item details, contact info |
| **ARCHIVE** | Item details, category, location |
| **DELETE** | EVERYTHING (preserved permanently) |

## Access the History

### From Admin Dashboard:
1. Login as admin
2. Go to Admin Dashboard
3. Click **"Activity History"** card (📊 icon)

### Direct URL:
```
/admin/history
```

## Visual Features

### Color-Coded Actions:
- 🔗 **MATCH** - Blue
- ✓ **CLAIM** - Green  
- 📦 **ARCHIVE** - Yellow
- 🗑️ **DELETE** - Red

### Filters Available:
- **Search** - By item name or admin email
- **Action Type** - Match, Claim, Archive, Delete, All
- **Item Type** - Lost, Found, All

### Statistics at Top:
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  15 Matches | 8 Claims | 3 Archives  │
│  2 Deletions | 0 Restores            │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Database Changes

Added new table: `ActivityLog`

```sql
CREATE TABLE "ActivityLog" (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  action TEXT NOT NULL,           -- 'MATCH', 'CLAIM', 'ARCHIVE', 'DELETE'
  itemType TEXT NOT NULL,         -- 'LOST' or 'FOUND'
  itemId TEXT NOT NULL,
  itemTitle TEXT NOT NULL,        -- Saved even if item deleted
  userId TEXT NOT NULL,           -- Admin who did it
  details TEXT,                   -- JSON with extra info
  createdAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW
);
```

## Example Usage

### Scenario: Admin Deletes a Lost Item

**Before Deletion:**
- Item exists in database
- Shows in "Manage Items" list

**Admin Action:**
1. Admin clicks "Delete" on "Nike Backpack"
2. Confirms deletion

**What Happens:**
1. Item removed from `LostItem` table
2. Activity log created:
   ```json
   {
     "action": "DELETE",
     "itemType": "LOST",
     "itemTitle": "Nike Backpack",
     "performedBy": "admin@school.edu",
     "details": {
       "category": "clothing",
       "description": "Blue Nike backpack with books",
       "location": "Basketball court",
       "lostDate": "2025-10-15"
     }
   }
   ```
3. Item disappears from "Manage Items"
4. Item visible in "Activity History"

**Result:**
- ✅ Dashboard stays clean
- ✅ Action tracked forever
- ✅ Can see who deleted it and when
- ✅ Can see full details even though item is gone

## Testing It

### Step 1: Create some test actions
1. Go to Admin → Manage Items
2. Click "Find Matches" on an item
3. Match it with something
4. Archive another item
5. Claim another item
6. Delete one item

### Step 2: View the history
1. Go to Admin → Activity History
2. You should see all 4 actions listed
3. Try the filters
4. Try searching

### Step 3: Verify details
1. Click on a log entry
2. See the stored details
3. Verify admin name shows correctly
4. Check timestamps are accurate

## Files to Know

**Frontend:**
- `src/app/admin/history/page.tsx` - The history page UI

**Backend:**
- `src/app/api/admin/history/route.ts` - Fetches logs
- `src/app/api/admin/actions/route.ts` - Creates logs

**Database:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - ActivityLog model
- `prisma/migrations/*_add_activity_log/` - Migration

## Troubleshooting

### "Activity not logging"
→ Make sure you're logged in as admin
→ Check console for errors
→ Verify database migration ran

### "Can't see history page"
→ Must be logged in as ADMIN role
→ Regular users can't access `/admin/history`

### "No data in history"
→ Logs only created for NEW actions after deployment
→ Perform some actions first

## What's Next? (Future Features)

1. **Restore Items** - Bring back archived items
2. **Export to CSV** - Download history reports
3. **Real-time Updates** - See actions as they happen
4. **Charts & Graphs** - Visualize activity trends
5. **Email Notifications** - Alert on important actions

## Summary

You now have:
- ✅ **Full audit trail** of all admin actions
- ✅ **Clean dashboard** (archived/deleted items don't clutter it)
- ✅ **Accountability** (know who did what and when)
- ✅ **Data preservation** (deleted items saved in logs)
- ✅ **Easy viewing** (dedicated history page with filters)

**Every action is tracked. Nothing is lost. Full transparency.**
