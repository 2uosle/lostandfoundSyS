# Report Confirmation Feature

## Overview
Added a beautiful confirmation screen that displays before submitting lost/found item reports. Users can review all their entered information before final submission.

## Features

### 🎨 Visual Design
- **Animated Modal**: Smooth fade-in and slide-up animations
- **Color-Coded**: Blue theme for lost items, green theme for found items
- **Responsive**: Works perfectly on mobile and desktop
- **Dark Mode**: Full dark mode support with proper contrast

### 📋 Information Display

The confirmation screen shows:
1. **Photo Preview** - Visual preview of uploaded image (if provided)
2. **Item Name** - The title entered by user
3. **Category** - Selected category with emoji
4. **Location** - Where the item was lost/found
5. **Date** - Formatted date (e.g., "January 15, 2025")
6. **Description** - Full description text
7. **Contact Info** - User's contact information
8. **Info Banner** - Contextual message about what happens next

### ✨ Animations

All elements animate in sequence with staggered delays:
- Modal: Fade-in + zoom-in (300ms)
- Header: Slide-in from bottom (500ms)
- Photo: Slide-in from left (500ms + 100ms delay)
- Details: Alternating left/right slides (500ms + varying delays)
- Actions: Slide-in from bottom (500ms + 400ms delay)

### 🔄 User Actions

1. **Edit Form** - Returns to the form with all data preserved
2. **Confirm & Submit** - Proceeds with submission
   - Shows loading spinner during submission
   - Disables both buttons to prevent double-submission

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
const [showConfirmation, setShowConfirmation] = useState(false);
const [formData, setFormData] = useState<FormData | null>(null);
```

### Form Submission Flow
1. User fills out the form
2. Clicks "Submit Report"
3. Form validates and processes image
4. Stores data in state
5. Shows confirmation modal
6. User reviews and clicks "Confirm & Submit"
7. Makes API call to submit
8. Shows success modal

### Image Handling
- Images are converted to base64 before showing confirmation
- Preview shows the actual image that will be uploaded
- Validation happens before confirmation screen
