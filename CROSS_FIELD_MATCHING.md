# Cross-Field Matching Enhancement

## Problem Statement

Users often distribute information differently across title and description fields:

**Lost Item:**
- Title: "Nike Backpack"
- Description: "Blue with a lot of shirts inside"

**Found Item:**
- Title: "Backpack"
- Description: "Nike black"

In the old system, these might not match well because:
- Title-to-title: "Nike Backpack" vs "Backpack" = partial match
- Description-to-description: "Blue with shirts" vs "Nike black" = low match

But clearly, "Nike" appears in both items, just in different fields!

## Solution: Cross-Field Matching

The algorithm now looks for keywords across all fields, not just matching field-to-field.

### How It Works

**Step 1: Extract Keywords**
- Lost Title: ["nike", "backpack"]
- Lost Description: ["blue", "lot", "shirts", "inside"]
- Found Title: ["backpack"]
- Found Description: ["nike", "black"]

**Step 2: Cross-Reference**
The algorithm checks four scenarios:

1. **Lost Title → Found Description**
   - "nike" from lost title appears in found description ✓
   - +2 points

2. **Found Title → Lost Description**
   - "backpack" from found title appears in lost description? No
   - +0 points

3. **Lost Description → Found Title**
   - Any keywords from lost description in found title? No
   - +0 points

4. **Found Description → Lost Title**
   - "nike" from found description appears in lost title ✓
   - +2 points

**Total Cross-Field Bonus: 4 points**

### Updated Scoring System

| Factor | Points | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Category Match | 40 | Must be same type |
| Title Similarity | 20 | Direct title match |
| Description Similarity | 15 | Direct description match |
| **Cross-Field Bonus** | **10** | **Keywords across fields** ⭐ NEW |
| **Combined Text Similarity** | **5** | **Overall text match** ⭐ NEW |
| Date Proximity | 10 | Timeline |
| Location Similarity | 10 | Where found/lost |

**Total: 100 points**

### Two New Matching Techniques

#### 1. Cross-Field Keyword Bonus (10 points max)

Awards 2 points for each keyword that appears in a different field:
- "Nike" in title matches "Nike" in description → +2
- "black" in description matches "black" in title → +2
- "backpack" in title matches "backpack" in description → +2

**Capped at 10 points** to prevent over-weighting.

#### 2. Combined Text Similarity (5 points)

Combines all text and compares as one:
- Lost: "Nike Backpack Blue with a lot of shirts inside"
- Found: "Backpack Nike black"

This catches overall similarity even when details are split differently.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Brand in Different Fields

**Lost Item:**
```
Title: "iPhone 13"
Description: "White color, found near the library"
```

**Found Item:**
```
Title: "White Phone"
Description: "iPhone 13 pro"
```

**Traditional Matching:**
- Title similarity: "iPhone 13" vs "White Phone" = ~30%
- Description similarity: "White color library" vs "iPhone 13 pro" = ~20%
- **Total: ~50 points**

**With Cross-Field Matching:**
- Title similarity: 20% × 20 = 4 points
- Description similarity: 20% × 15 = 3 points
- Cross-field: "iPhone" appears in both, "13" appears in both, "white" appears in both = 6 points
- Combined similarity: High overall = 4 points
- **Total: ~65 points** ✓ Much better!

### Example 2: Color/Brand Split

**Lost Item:**
```
Title: "Blue Nike Backpack"
Description: "Has a laptop inside"
```

**Found Item:**
```
Title: "Backpack with laptop"
Description: "Blue Nike brand"
```

**Cross-Field Matches:**
- "blue" (lost title) → "blue" (found description) ✓
- "nike" (lost title) → "nike" (found description) ✓
- "backpack" (lost title) → "backpack" (found title) ✓
- "laptop" (lost description) → "laptop" (found title) ✓

**Result: High match score!**

### Example 3: Model Numbers

**Lost Item:**
```
Title: "AirPods Pro"
Description: "2nd generation, white case"
```

**Found Item:**
```
Title: "White AirPods"
Description: "Pro 2nd gen"
```

**Cross-Field Matches:**
- "airpods" appears in both titles ✓
- "pro" (lost title) → "pro" (found description) ✓
- "white" (lost description) → "white" (found title) ✓
- "2nd" appears in both descriptions ✓

**Result: Excellent match!**

## How This Solves Your Example

**Your Example:**

**Lost:**
- Title: "Nike Backpack"
- Description: "Blue with a lot of shirts inside"

**Found:**
- Title: "Backpack"
- Description: "Nike black"

**Breakdown:**

| Component | Score | Details |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Category | 40 | Both "clothing" ✓ |
| Title Similarity | ~12 | "backpack" matches partially |
| Description Similarity | ~2 | Different colors/details |
| **Cross-Field** | **4** | "nike" cross-matches ✓ |
| **Combined Text** | **3** | Overall keywords overlap |
| Date | 8 | Same day |
| Location | 10 | Same location |

**Total: ~79 points** ✓ Strong match!

Without cross-field matching, this would only score ~62 points.

## Technical Implementation

```typescript
function calculateCrossFieldBonus(
  lostTitle, lostDesc,
  foundTitle, foundDesc
) {
  // Extract unique keywords from each field
  const lostTitleKW = extractKeywords(lostTitle);
  const lostDescKW = extractKeywords(lostDesc);
  const foundTitleKW = extractKeywords(foundTitle);
  const foundDescKW = extractKeywords(foundDesc);
  
  let bonus = 0;
  
  // Check all four cross-field combinations
  bonus += countMatches(lostTitleKW, foundDescKW) * 2;
  bonus += countMatches(foundTitleKW, lostDescKW) * 2;
  bonus += countMatches(lostDescKW, foundTitleKW) * 2;
  bonus += countMatches(foundDescKW, lostTitleKW) * 2;
  
  return Math.min(10, bonus); // Cap at 10 points
}
```

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Flexible Data Entry**: Users don't need to format information the same way
2. ✅ **Better Matches**: Catches items that are clearly the same despite different field distribution
3. ✅ **Handles Real Behavior**: People naturally put details in different places
4. ✅ **Brand Recognition**: Brand names anywhere in either item will match
5. ✅ **Color/Size/Model**: Key details matched regardless of where they're mentioned

## Edge Cases Handled

**Case 1: Minimal Title**
- Lost: Title="Backpack", Desc="Nike blue with books"
- Found: Title="Nike Backpack", Desc="blue color"
- Result: ✓ Matches via cross-field

**Case 2: Detailed Description**
- Lost: Title="Phone", Desc="iPhone 13 Pro Max blue"
- Found: Title="iPhone 13", Desc="Phone with blue case"
- Result: ✓ Matches via cross-field + combined text

**Case 3: Different Order**
- Lost: Title="Red Nike Shoes", Desc="Size 10"
- Found: Title="Size 10 Shoes", Desc="Red Nike brand"
- Result: ✓ Strong match despite completely different ordering

## Testing

Try these test cases:

1. **Brand Split**
   - Lost: "Nike Backpack" / "blue color"
   - Found: "Backpack" / "Nike blue"
   - Expected: High match ✓

2. **Model Number Split**
   - Lost: "iPhone" / "Model 13 pro"
   - Found: "iPhone 13" / "Pro model"
   - Expected: High match ✓

3. **Color Split**
   - Lost: "Blue Wallet" / "leather"
   - Found: "Wallet" / "blue leather"
   - Expected: High match ✓

## Summary

The matching algorithm now:
- ✅ Looks for keywords across ALL fields, not just matching field-to-field
- ✅ Rewards when important details (brand, color, model) appear anywhere
- ✅ Combines all text for overall similarity
- ✅ Handles real-world data entry patterns
- ✅ Still prioritizes exact field matches but isn't limited by them
