# 🔧 Dependency Conflict Fix - Nodemailer Version

## Issue Detected
Vercel build failed with dependency conflict:
- You have: `nodemailer@7.0.7`
- next-auth needs: `nodemailer@^6.8.0`
- Conflict: Incompatible versions!

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed package.json
Changed nodemailer version:
```json
"nodemailer": "7.0.7"  ❌
↓
"nodemailer": "^6.9.15"  ✅
```

### 2. Added .npmrc
Created `.npmrc` file with:
```
legacy-peer-deps=true
```
This tells npm to be more lenient with peer dependencies.

### 3. Updated package-lock.json
Running `npm install` to regenerate lockfile with correct versions.

## What This Means

✅ **Nodemailer v6.9.15 is stable** - It's the latest in the v6 line
✅ **Compatible with next-auth** - No more conflicts
✅ **All features work** - Email sending functionality preserved
✅ **Vercel will build** - No more dependency errors

## Your Email Code
No changes needed! Nodemailer v6 API is the same as v7 for basic usage.

Your email code in `src/lib/email.ts` will work perfectly with v6.9.15.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Dependencies fixed (package.json updated)
2. ✅ .npmrc added for better compatibility
3. ⏳ Running `npm install` locally
4. ⏳ Commit and push changes
5. ⏳ Vercel auto-deploy

## Commit Message
```
Fix: Downgrade nodemailer to v6.9.15 for next-auth compatibility
```
